## What is it

## How do I run it


## todo

* much wider sliders
* show slider zones (some are very unlikely to get randomly selected)
* interruptable search somehow (...web workers? requestAnimationFrame?)
* many results, not just the best so far... maybe add anything better than the 50 best so far? anything below 1?
* increase search space - maybe just 1 more digit
* db approach? 1000000 * 10 * 23 floats = ... 230MB of database? easy
