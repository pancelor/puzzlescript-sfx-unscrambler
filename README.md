## What is it

## How do I run it


## todo

* much wider sliders
* weights (adjustable or set) per-slider
* show slider zones (some are very unlikely to get randomly selected)
* interruptable search somehow (...web workers? requestAnimationFrame?)
* many results, not just the best so far... maybe add anything better than the 50 best so far? anything below 1?
